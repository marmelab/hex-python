## The Hex game

### Introduction

    It's a tradition at Marmelab to code a board game during the integration period. For me, it's an implementation of the Hex game that was expected.

    Hex game is a strategy game, played by two players, on a board. Piet Hein (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piet_Hein_(scientist)) and John Nash (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Forbes_Nash_Jr.) invented him independently during 1940s. Many size and shape are possible but 11x11 rhombus is commonly used as the default configuration.

    ## Rules of the game

    The goal is to join color sides with a chain of stones.

    Each players has stones of color black or white and alternatively places stones on the board. Like chess, white stones player starts.
